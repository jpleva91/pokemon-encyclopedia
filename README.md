# Pokémon Encyclopedia
A modern, interactive Pokémon encyclopedia built with Angular 20, featuring Bill's AI-powered PC system for exploring and comparing Pokémon data.

# Agentic Architecture
The AI chat isn’t just text-based—it uses a generative AI agent to:
	•	Understand user queries
	•	Dynamically choose which tools to invoke (e.g. Pokémon details, comparisons, filtered lists)
	•	Decide which UI components to render on the fly (cards, tables, lists)

This enables a truly interactive experience where the AI orchestrates both data retrieval and the user interface in real-time.

## Key Features Explained

### AI Chat with Bill
The chat interface allows users to interact with Bill, who can:
- Show individual Pokémon details
- Compare multiple Pokémon
- List Pokémon by type or generation
- Answer questions about Pokémon stats and abilities

### Resource API Implementation
All data fetching uses Angular's new Resource API for:
- Automatic request cancellation
- Built-in loading states
- Memory leak prevention
- Optimized re-fetching with equality checks

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient data fetching with request deduplication
- Optimized change detection with OnPush strategy
- Smart equality checks to prevent unnecessary API calls

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Deploy to Vercel:
```bash
vercel
```

3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

### Environment Variables
