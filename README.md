# Pok√©mon Encyclopedia
A modern, interactive Pok√©mon encyclopedia built with Angular 20, featuring Bill's AI-powered PC system for exploring and comparing Pok√©mon data.

# Agentic Architecture
The AI chat isn‚Äôt just text-based‚Äîit uses a generative AI agent to:
	‚Ä¢	Understand user queries
	‚Ä¢	Dynamically choose which tools to invoke (e.g. Pok√©mon details, comparisons, filtered lists)
	‚Ä¢	Decide which UI components to render on the fly (cards, tables, lists)

This enables a truly interactive experience where the AI orchestrates both data retrieval and the user interface in real-time.
